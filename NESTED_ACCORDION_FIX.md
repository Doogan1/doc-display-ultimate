# Nested Accordion Fix Summary

## Issue Description
When accordions were set to `accordion_default="closed"`, opening a parent folder would show all nested accordion content even though the nested accordion toggle buttons showed `aria-expanded="false"`. This created a confusing user experience where nested content was visible but appeared to be in a closed state.

## Root Cause
The problem was in the JavaScript accordion toggle logic and CSS rules:

1. **JavaScript Issue**: When opening a parent accordion, the code was showing all nested content without properly checking the state of nested accordions
2. **CSS Issue**: The CSS rules weren't specific enough to handle nested accordion states properly
3. **Initialization Issue**: The page wasn't properly initializing accordion states based on their `aria-expanded` attributes

## Fixes Applied

### 1. JavaScript Accordion Toggle Logic (frontend.js)
- **Enhanced parent opening logic**: When opening a parent accordion, the code now checks each nested accordion's `aria-expanded` state and maintains that state
- **Added initialization function**: `initAccordionStates()` ensures all accordions start in the correct state based on their `aria-expanded` attributes when the page loads

### 2. CSS Rules (frontend.css)
- **Added specific rules for nested accordions**: Ensures nested accordion content respects its own state when parent is open
- **Added aria-expanded based rules**: Uses `!important` to ensure content visibility is controlled by the `aria-expanded` attribute
- **Enhanced nested folder rules**: Better handling of nested folder visibility states

### 3. Key CSS Rules Added
```css
/* Ensure accordion content is hidden when aria-expanded is false */
.filebird-docs-accordion-toggle[aria-expanded="false"] + .filebird-docs-accordion-content {
    display: none !important;
}

/* Ensure accordion content is visible when aria-expanded is true */
.filebird-docs-accordion-toggle[aria-expanded="true"] + .filebird-docs-accordion-content {
    display: block !important;
}

/* Ensure nested accordion content respects its own state when parent is open */
.filebird-docs-accordion-content.filebird-docs-accordion-open .filebird-docs-accordion-content:not(.filebird-docs-accordion-open) {
    display: none;
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Default Closed State**: When `accordion_default="closed"`, all accordions (including nested) start closed
2. **Parent Opening**: When opening a parent accordion, nested accordions maintain their closed state unless manually opened
3. **Nested Toggle**: Each nested accordion can be independently opened/closed without affecting siblings
4. **Parent Closing**: When closing a parent accordion, all nested accordions are also closed
5. **Visual Consistency**: The accordion icons and content visibility always match the `aria-expanded` state

## Testing Scenarios
- [ ] Test with `accordion_default="closed"` - all accordions should start closed
- [ ] Test with `accordion_default="open"` - all accordions should start open
- [ ] Test opening a parent accordion - nested accordions should remain in their current state
- [ ] Test closing a parent accordion - all nested accordions should close
- [ ] Test toggling nested accordions independently
- [ ] Test deep nesting (3+ levels) - all levels should behave correctly
